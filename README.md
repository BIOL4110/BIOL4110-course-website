## Lecture Schedule

We will be employing a lot of active learning in this course, as you learn programming best by doing! During lecture, we will work in small breakout groups on a lecture worksheet (a Jupyter notebook) that will allow us to practice together.

| Lecture | Topic                         | Lecture notes                                                                                                                              | Supplementary resources |
