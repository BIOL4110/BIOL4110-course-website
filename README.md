# BIOL4110 - Ecological Methods

# Welcome!

Welcome to Ecological (Data Science) Methods! This class is designed to empower students to wrangle, visualize and analyse ecological data using modern data analysis tools. Student will learn how to:

-   explore, clean, visualize and analyse ecological data

-   make their methods reproducible, reusable, and shareable

-   use R's modern landscape.

## Lecture Schedule

We will be employing a lot of active learning in this course, as you learn programming best by doing! During lecture, we will work in small breakout groups on a lecture worksheet (a Jupyter notebook) that will allow us to practice together. Up-to-date course schedule (including due dates etc) [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XCHy3uUEuU_KMlzEBVErvB13R-Ka06vargoKFpHReaE/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
