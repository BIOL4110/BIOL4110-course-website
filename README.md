## Lecture Schedule

We will be employing a lot of active learning in this course, as you learn programming best by doing! During lecture, we will work in small breakout groups on a lecture worksheet (a Jupyter notebook) that allow us to practice together.

| Lecture | Topic                                                             | Required readings                                                                           | Supplementary resources                                                        |
